# Depo Blockchain 

*(Note: This repository is under active development)*

- 10-100x cheaper fees than Ethereum Mainnet (go even cheaper with data availability committee support)
- Interoperability with Mainnet through trustless bridging and fraud proofs
- Close Ethereum Compatibility, so you can use the same workflows and tooling
- Smart contracts in a more performant VM with Rust, C++, or other languages that can compile to WASM. These contracts can interoperate synchronously with the EVM.
